Analyzing Consumer Buying Patterns and Predicting Sales with Artificial Intelligence

Our final year B.E. project entails the development of a sophisticated sales forecasting system that leverages artificial intelligence. This system is designed to predict product sales by utilizing time-series data and product attributes. The core algorithm is founded on multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The outcome of our training efforts is presented below.
